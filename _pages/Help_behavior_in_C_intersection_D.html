    Mathematical Model
   </h2>
   <p>
    Consider the hybrid system with data
   </p>
   <p>
    \[\begin{array}{ll}
f(x) := x & C:= [1, 3] \cup [5, 9] \\ \\
g(x) := \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
                      \mathrm{round}(x+1) & \textrm{if } x \leq 6 \\
                      0 & \textrm{if } x = 7
\end{array}\right. & D:= \{0\}\cup [2, 6] \cup \{7\}.
\end{array}\]
   </p>
   <p>
    The sets
    \(C\)
    and
    \(D\)
    are visualized here:
   </p>
   <p>
    \[\begin{array}{cccccccccccc}
   C: &   & [ &   & ] &   & [ &   &   &   & ]
\\ D: & * &   & [ &   &   &   & ] & * &   &
\\ \hline
   x: &     0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9
\end{array}\]
   </p>
   <p>
    Solutions to this model are not unique because solutions are allowed to both flow or jump everywhere in
    \([2, 3) \cup [5, 6] \cup \{7\}.\)
    (Note that despite
    \(3\)
    being in
    \(C\cap D\)
    , it is not possible to flow because the trajectory would immediately leave
    \(C\)
    .)
   </p>

    Priority Rules for Intersection of C and D
   </h2>
   <p>
    When solving hybrid systems, the HyEQ Toolbox only computes a single solution, so we must specify which of the various possible solutions are computed. This is done is by defining a variable
    <tt>rule</tt>
    in the MATLAB workspace. The value of
    <tt>rule</tt>
    specifies whether flows or jumps have priority in
    \(C \cap D\)
    .
   </p>
   <div>
    <ul>
     <li>
      If
      <tt>rule = 1</tt>
      , jumps have priority.
     </li>
     <li>
      If
      <tt>rule = 2</tt>
      , flows have priority.
     </li>
     <li>
      If
      <tt>rule = 3</tt>
      , then flowing and jumping is randomly selected at each time step.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </div>
   <p>
    The following simulations show the use of the variable
    <tt>rule</tt>
    priority of flowing vs jumping when computing solutions inside
    \(C\cap D\)
    .
   </p>
   <h2 id="4">
    Jump Priority (
    <tt>rule = 1</tt>
    )
   </h2>
   <p>
    When
    <tt>rule=1</tt>
    , jumps have priorty, so anytime a (numerical) solution
    \(x\)
    is in
    \(C\cap D\)
    , then
    \(x\)
    will jump. For the model presented above, this effectively restricts
    \(C\)
    as shown here:
   </p>
   <p>
    \[\begin{array}{rccccccccccc}
 C \textrm{ (effective)}: &   & [ & ) &   &   &   & ( &\circ&   & ]
\\ D:                     & * &   & [ &   &   &   & ] &  *  &   &
\\ \hline
 x:                       & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 &  7  & 8 & 9
\end{array}\]
   </p>
   <p>
    The following plot shows a solution from
    \(x0=0\)
    with jump priority (
    <tt>rule=1</tt>
    ). The solution always jumps except when
    \(x\)
    is in
    \([1, 2) \subset C \setminus D\)
    .

    Flow Priority (

    )
   </h2>
   <p>
    When
    <tt>rule=2</tt>
    , flows have priorty, so anytime a solution
    \(x\)
    is in
    \(C\cap D\)
    , then
    \(x\)
    will flow unless
    \(x\)
    is on the boundary of
    \(C\)
    and
    \(f(x)\)
    points out of
    \(C\)
    . For the model presented above, this effectively restricts
    \(C\)
    as shown here:
   </p>
   <p>
    \[\begin{array}{rccccccccccc}
   C:                       &   & [ &   & ] &   & [ &   &   &   & ]
\\ D \textrm{ (effective)}: & * &   &   & ( &   & ) &   &   &   &
\\ \hline

   </p>
   <p>
    The following plot shows a solution from
    \(x0=0\)
    with flow priority (
    <tt>rule=2</tt>
    ). The solution only jumps when
    \(x\)
    is in
    \(\{0\} \cup (3, 4) = D \setminus C\)
    . At the end of the solution,
    \(x\)
    leaves
    \(C \cup D\)
    and terminates.

   <p>
    Note that the stopping logic is implemented such that when the state of the hybrid system is not in
    \((C \cup D)\)
    , then the simulation is stopped. In particular, if this condition becomes true while flowing, then the last value of the computed solution will not belong to
    \(C\)
    .

    Random Priority (
    <tt>rule = 3</tt>
    )
   </h2>
   <p>
    When
    <tt>rule=3</tt>
    , then at each time step that a solution
    \(x\)
    is in
    \(C \cap D,\)
    there is 50% chance of jumping and 50% chance of flowing.
   </p>
   <p>
    For the model presented above, the intersection of
    \(C\)
    and
    \(D\)
    is illustrated here. Within the intersection, either flowing or jumping can occur in numerical solutions.
   </p>
   <p>
    \[\begin{array}{cccccccccccc}
C \cap D: &   &   & [ & ] &   & [ & ] & * &   &
\\ \hline
x:        & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9
\end{array}\]
   </p>
   <p>
    A solution computed with
    <tt>rule=3</tt>
    is shown below. The first interval of flow ends around
    \(t=0.7\)
    , shortly after the solution enters
    \([2,3]\)
    . Because there is a 50-50 chance of jumping at each time step, jumps tend to happen very quickly when a solution enters an interval in
    \(C \cap D\)
    . The solution then jumps several times in
    \(D \setminus C\)
    until
    \(x = 7 \in C\cap D\)
    . The first time this happens, the solution happens to jump, reseting
    \(x\)
    to
    \(0\)
    , but the second time it happens to flow, causing it to leave
    \(D\)
    and eventually leave
    \(C\)
    as well.

    Numerical Limitations
   </h2>
   <p>
    Isolated points in
    \(D\)
    that are also in
    \(C\)
    , such as
    \(x=7\)
    , require extra care. If a solution starts at
    <tt>x0=6.1</tt>
    , then it will almost certainly flow pass
    \(7 \in D\)
    without jumping (even if
    <tt>rule=1</tt>
    ) because the odds of the numerical value of
    <tt>x</tt>
    ever being exactly
    \(7\)
    is minuscule. Thus, from a numerical standpoint,
    <tt>x</tt>
    never enters
    \(D\)
    . Isolated points in
    \(D\)
    on the boundary of
    \(C\)
    require similar care, as the solution is likely to terminate rather than enter the jump set.

   <p>
    Furthermore, suppose the jump map given above is modified by removing the
    \(\mathrm{round}\)
    function, as shown here
   </p>
   <p>
    \[g(x) := \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
                      x+1 & \textrm{if } x \leq 6 \\
                      0 & \textrm{if } x = 7.
\end{array}\right. \]
   </p>
   <p>
    For a solution from
    <tt>x0=1</tt>
    with jump priority
    <tt>rule=1</tt>
    , one might expect that a solution will flow until
    \(x = 2\in D,\)
    jump several times until
    \(x=7\in D\)
    and reset to
    \(x=0\)
    . This will not happen, however, because the numerical solver cannot determine the exact position of
    \(x\)
    when it enters
    \(D\)
    at
    \(x=2\)
    , so the solution flows slightly past
    \(2\)
    , say, to
    \(2.0001\)
    . Then, after several jumps,
    \(x\)
    is at
    \(7.0001 \not\in D\)
    , at which point it flows until it leaves
    \(C.\)
    Therefore, one must be careful in the design of
    \(C\)
    and
    \(D\)
    to ensure that numerical calculations do not create undesired behavior.

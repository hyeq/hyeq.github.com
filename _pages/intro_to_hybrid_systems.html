    This document gives a brief introduction to the mathematical modeling of hybrid systems and their solutions. A hybrid system
    \(\mathcal{H}\)
    with state
    \(x\in \mathbb{R}^n\)
    is modeled as follows:
   </p>
   <p>
    \[\mathcal{H}: \left\{\begin{array}{rl}
    \dot x = f(x) & x \in C
      \\
    x^+ = g(x) &x \in D
\end{array} \right.
\]
   </p>
   <p>
    Throughout the HyEQ documentation,
    \(\mathbb{R}\)
    denotes the set of real numbers and
    \(\mathbb{N} := \{0, 1, \dots\}\)
    denotes the set of natural numbers. We define
    \(\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} := [0, \infty).\)
   </p>
   <p>
    The representation of
    \(\mathcal{H}\)
    , above, indicates that the state
    \(x\)
    can evolve or
    <i>
     flow
    </i>
    according to the differential equation
    \(\dot x = f(x)\)
    while
    \(x \in C,\)
    and can
    <i>
     jump
    </i>
    according to the difference equation
    \(x^+ = g(x)\)
    while
    \(x \in D.\)
    The function
    \(f : C \to \mathbb{R}^n\)
    is called the
    <i>
     flow map
    </i>
    , the set
    \(C \subset \mathbb{R}^n\)
    is called the
    <i>
     flow set
    </i>
    , the function
    \(g : D \to \mathbb{R}^n\)
    is called the
    <i>
     jump map
    </i>
    , and the set
    \(D \subset \mathbb{R}^n\)
    is called the
    <i>
     jump set
    </i>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    Roughly speaking, a function
    \(\phi : E \to \mathbb{R}^n\)
    is a
    <i>
     solution
    </i>
    to
    \(\mathcal{H}\)
    if the following conditions are satisfied:
   </p>
   <div>
    <ol>
     <li>
      \(\phi(0, 0) \in \overline{C} \cup D.\)
     </li>
     <li>
      The domain
      \(E \subset \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{N}\)
      is a
      <i>
       hybrid time domain
      </i>
      where for each
      \((t, j) \in E\)
      , the
      \(t\)
      component is the amount of ordinary time that has elapsed and the
      \(j\)
      component is the number
      \(j\)
      of discrete jumps that have occured.
     </li>
     <li>
      For all
      \(j\in \mathbb{N}\)
      such that
      \(I^j := \{t \mid (t, j) \in E\}\)
      has nonempty interior, we have that
      \(\phi(t, j) \in C\)
      for all
      \(t \in \mathrm{int}\: I^j\)
      and
      \(\frac{d\phi}{dt} = f(\phi(t, j))\)
      for almost all
      \(t \in I^j\)
      . We call
      \(I^j\)
      an
      <i>
       interval of flow
      </i>
      .
     </li>
     <li>
      At each
      \((t, j) \in E\)
      such that
      \((t, j+1) \in E\)
      , then
      \(\phi(t, j) \in D\)
      and
      \(\phi(t, j+1) = g(\phi(t, j))\)
      . We call such a
      \((t, j)\)
      a
      <i>
       jump time
      </i>
      .

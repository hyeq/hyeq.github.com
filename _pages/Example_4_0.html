    Following the model of a physical component
   </p>
   <p>
    \[\begin{array}{ll}
\dot{x} = f(x,u),
      & C := \{ x \mid x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}\}, \\
x^+ = g(x) = \emptyset, \quad
      & D := \emptyset, \\
y = h(x,u),
\end{array}\]
   </p>
   <p>
    a linear time-invariant model of the physical component is defined by
   </p>
   <p>
    \[\begin{array}{l}
f(x,u) = f_P(x,u)= A_P x + B_P u, \\ h(x,u) = h(x,u) = M_P x + N_P u
\end{array}
\]
   </p>
   <p>
    where
    \(A_P\)
    ,
    \(B_P\)
    ,
    \(M_P\)
    , and
    \(N_P\)
    are matrices of appropriate dimensions. State and input constraints can directly be embedded into the set
    \(C_P\)
    . For example, the constraint that
    \(x\)
    has all of its components nonnegative and that
    \(u\)
    has its components with norm less or equal than one is captured by
   </p>
   <p>
    \[\begin{array}{ll}
C_P = \{(x,u)\in\mathbb{R}^{n_P}\times \mathbb{R}^{m_P}\mid x_i \geq 0 \ \forall i \in \{1,2,\ldots,n_P\}\}
\\ \quad\qquad {} \cap \{(x,u)\in\mathbb{R}^{n_P}\times \mathbb{R}^{m_P} \mid |u_i| \leq 1 \  \forall i \in \{1,2,\ldots,m_P\}\}
\end{array}
\]

    For example, the evolution of the temperature of a room with a heater can be modeled by a linear-time invariant system with state
    \(x\)
    denoting the temperature of the room and with input
    \(u = (u_1,u_2)\)
    , where
    \(u_1\)
    denotes whether the heater is turned on (
    \(u_1 = 1\)
    ) or turned off (
    \(u_1 = 0\)
    ) while
    \(u_2\)
    denotes the temperature outside the room. The evolution of the temperature is given by
   </p>
   <p>
    \[\begin{array}{l}
 \dot{x} = -x + [z_\Delta \quad 1] \left[\begin{array}{c} u_1 \\
  u_2\end{array}\right] \textrm{ when } (x,u)\in C_P = \{(x,u) \in \mathbb{R} \times\mathbb{R}^2 \mid u_1 \in \{0,1\}\}
\end{array}
\]
   </p>
   <p>
    where
    \(z_\Delta\)
    is a constant representing the heater capacity.

    Version 3.0 of the Hybrid Equation Toolbox includes substantial improvements to most aspects of the MATLAB-based solver and plotting functions. All code written using v2.04 should continue to work on v3.0, but will need to be to modified to take advantage of some of the new features. This document describes how to make those change. Hybrid systems defined in Simulink can be left unmodified, but the plotting of solutions can be updated to take advantage of new tools.

    Defining Hybrid Systems
   </h2>
   <p>
    In v2.04, a hybrid system was defined by creating four MATLAB function files
    <tt>C.m</tt>
    ,
    <tt>f.m</tt>
    ,
    <tt>D.m</tt>
    , and
    <tt>g.m</tt>
    anywhere on the MATLAB search path. Examples for the bouncing ball are shown at the end of this section. The only way that these four functions are grouped together, as far as MATLAB knows, is that they are all be passed together to
    <tt>HyEQsolver</tt>
    , e.g.,
    <tt>HyEQsolver(@f, @g, @C, @D, ...)</tt>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    In v3.0, we introduced the
    <tt>HybridSystem</tt>
    class so that all of the data of a hybrid system is encapsulated in a single place. This has numerous benfits:
   </p>
   <div>
    <ul>
     <li>
      All of the data of hybrid system are defined in one place.
     </li>
     <li>
      It is possible to have many hybrid systems defined on the MATLAB path without worrying about name conflicts.
     </li>
     <li>
      It is no longer necessary to use global variables to define constants (see
      <tt>gamma</tt>
      and
      <tt>lambda</tt>
      , below).
     </li>
    </ul>
   </div>
   <p>
    For a detailed description of how to write
    <tt>HybridSystem</tt>
    classes, see
    <a href="/HybridSystem_demo">How to Implement and Solve a Hybrid System</a>
    . Now, you might not be interested in rewriting existing code but still want to take advantage of new features. As a half-way step, we have provided a method for creating a
    <tt>HybridSystem</tt>
    object from existing
    <tt>C.m</tt>
    ,
    <tt>f.m</tt>
    ,
    <tt>D.m</tt>
    , and
    <tt>g.m</tt>
    files:
   </p>
   <pre class="language-matlab">sys = HybridSystem(@f, @g, @C, @D);
</pre>
   <p>
    The
    <tt>sys</tt>
    object can then be used just like any other
    <tt>HybridSystem</tt>
    . There are a couple of disadvantages of this approach, however. Namely, it misses out on the advantages associated with defining all of a hybrid system's data in a single file, listed above, and the computation of solutions is slower and harder to debug. For these reasons, we strongly reccomend writing new
    <tt>HybridSystem</tt>
    subclasses whenever writing new code.

    Solving Hybrid Systems
   </h2>
   <p>
    In v2.04, computing a solution required the data of the system, the initial condition, time horizons, jump/flow priority, and ODE solver options to
    <tt>HyEQsolver</tt>
    :
   </p>
   <pre class="language-matlab">% Initial conditions
x0 = [1; 0];
</pre>
   <pre class="language-matlab">% Simulation horizon
TSPAN = [0 10];
JSPAN = [0 20];
</pre>
   <pre class="language-matlab">% Set the behavior of the simulation in the intersection of C and D.
rule = 1;
</pre>
   <pre class="language-matlab">% ODE solver options.
options = odeset('RelTol',1e-6, 'MaxStep', 0.1);
</pre>
   <pre class="language-matlab">[t j x] = HyEQsolver(@f, @g, @C, @D, x0, TSPAN, JSPAN, rule, options);
</pre>
   <p>
    For v3.0, the above process is split into two steps. First, you define a hybrid system, as we did for
    <tt>sys</tt>
    , above. Then call the
    <tt>sys.solve</tt>
    to comput the solution. The function
    <tt>sys.solve</tt>
    function takes as arguments
    <tt>x0</tt>
    ,
    <tt>tspan</tt>
    , and
    <tt>jspan</tt>
    , similar to
    <tt>HyEQsolver</tt>
    . Where it differs is in the (optional) fourth argument
    <tt>config</tt>
    , which is a
    <tt>HybridSolverConfig</tt>
    object used to define the jump/flow priorty and ODE solver options, as well as controlling how progress updates are displayed. To use the ODE option given above, simply pass change
    <tt>options = odeset('RelTol',1e-6, 'MaxStep', 0.1);</tt>
    to
   </p>
   <pre class="language-matlab">config = HybridSolverConfig('RelTol',1e-6, 'MaxStep', 0.1);
</pre>
   <p>
    Then, to set jump priority in the intersection of C and D, call
    <tt>config.priority('jump');</tt>
    (to set flow priority, this would be
    <tt>config.priority('flow');</tt>
    ). Finally, to compute the solution, call
   </p>
   <pre class="language-matlab">sol = sys.solve(x0, tspan, jspan, config);
</pre>
   <p>
    The resulting object is a
    <tt>HybridSolution</tt>
    object (which is a subclass of the
    <tt>HybridArc</tt>
    class). To extract the values of
    <tt>x, t, j</tt>
    in order to, say, continue using the v2.04 plotting functions, simply call
   </p>
   <pre class="language-matlab">t = sol.t;
j = sol.j;
x = sol.x;
</pre>
   <h2 id="3">
    Plotting Solutions
   </h2>
   <p>
    Creating plots with v3.0 is easier and more flexible. However, it requires that the data you want to plot is contained in a
    <tt>HybridArc</tt>
    object (or a
    <tt>HybridSolution</tt>
    object). If you are still using
    <tt>HyEQsolver</tt>
    to compute solutions, then your data is in the form of three variables,
    <tt>t, j, x</tt>
    . Thankfully, you can generate a
    <tt>HybridArc</tt>
    from this data by simply calling
   </p>
   <pre class="language-matlab">sol = HybridArc(t, j, x);
</pre>
   <p>
    Then, the hybrid arc can be plotted using all of the tools described in
    <a href="/HybridPlotBuilder_demo">Plotting Hybrid Arcs</a>
    .

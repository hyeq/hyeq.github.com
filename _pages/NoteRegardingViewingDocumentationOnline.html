   <p>
    The HyEQ Toolbox documentation is only designed to be read within MATLAB Help. Most of the links will not work when viewed online, such on the Mathworks File Exchange website. In particular, links between documentation files and links to particular Toolbox files (e.g., example files) will not work because MATLAB commands are used to resolve the links.
